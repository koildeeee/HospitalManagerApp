# My Personal Project: MyHospitalManager

### What does the application do?

The application I am designing is a hospital management application.

### Who will use it?

This application is intended for use by hospital personnel.

### Why is this project of interest to me?

I find this project fascinating because I went into Computer Science with the intent of pursuing bioinformatics.
Ever since I was young, I have been interested in the field of medicine, largely due to the fact that my parents
pursued medicine while they were in college. As such, I feel like this term project is a way to bridge my two passions
and pursue my interests further.
