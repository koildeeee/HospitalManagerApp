# My Personal Project: MyHospitalManager

### What does the application do?

The application I am designing is a healthcare management application,
which allows patients and hospital personnel to interact in various ways.

### Who will use it? 

This application is intended for use by prospective patients and hospital personnel.

### Why is this project of interest to me? 

I find this project fascinating because I went into Computer Science with the intent of pursuing bioinformatics.
Ever since I was young, I have been interested in the field of medicine, largely due to the fact that my parents 
pursued medicine while they were in college. As such, I feel like this term project is a way to bridge my two passions 
and pursue my interests further.
